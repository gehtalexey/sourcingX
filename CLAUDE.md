# SourcingX — AI-Powered Recruiting Automation

## Workflow Rules

- **Desktop (Claude Code CLI):** Before the **first** change on `master` in a session, confirm with Alexey once and offer a feature branch. After he confirms, treat subsequent edits, commits, and pushes to `master` in that same session as authorized — don't re-prompt for each one. The confirmation resets at the start of a new session.
- **Mobile (Claude app):** Branches are created automatically - safe by default.
- **Codex code review:** Codex (second AI coding agent) reviews all code Claude writes in this project. Flow: Claude opens a PR against `master` → Codex finds the latest open SourcingX PR and posts its review directly on GitHub → Claude reads the PR comments/reviews (via `gh pr view --comments`, `gh api`, or equivalent) and applies fixes on the same branch. Codex does not edit files; Alexey does not relay feedback by hand. Before applying Codex's fixes, re-read the file in case state has changed since the review.

## AI coding workflow

This repo uses GitHub PRs as the coordination layer between Claude (the code-writing agent), Codex (the reviewing agent), and Alexey. Default rules:

1. **Feature branches only.** Claude implements changes on a feature branch named `<type>/<short-slug>` (e.g. `fix/profiles-status`, `chore/ai-pr-workflow`). Direct commits to `master` are only allowed for the explicit session exception above.
2. **PR is the unit of review.** When a feature branch is ready, open a PR against `master`. The PR description states what changed, why, and what was tested. Codex reviews the PR, Claude applies fixes on the same branch, and Alexey merges.
3. **Reference REVIEW.md.** Both Claude (self-review before pushing) and Codex (reviewing the PR) use the checklist in `REVIEW.md` as the criteria. New PRs that touch production code paths should pass that checklist before merge.
4. **CI is required.** The GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs focused tests on every push and PR targeting `master`. PRs do not merge until CI is green.
5. **No auto-merge.** Merges are manual. Alexey reviews the final state and clicks merge himself.
6. **No broad write permissions for CI.** The workflow declares `permissions: contents: read` explicitly. Any future job that needs write access must be added narrowly and reviewed.
7. **No secrets in the repo.** Real API keys live in `config.json` (gitignored) or GitHub Actions secrets, never in source. Test code uses placeholder keys (`"test-key"`) which the workflow injects via env. Local agent state such as `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/launch.json`, `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`, `.claude/worktrees/`, `.agent/`, `.agents/`, `.continue/`, and scratch JSON/CSV outputs is gitignored and must never be committed. Tracked project skill files under `.claude/skills/` are allowed only when intentionally maintained as repo instructions.

### Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`. Subject ≤72 chars, lowercase, imperative, no trailing period.

## Project Overview

SourcingX is a Streamlit-based recruiting automation platform that screens LinkedIn profiles against job descriptions using AI. It integrates with Crustdata (profile enrichment), PhantomBuster (LinkedIn scraping), SalesQL (email lookup), and OpenAI (AI screening).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend/Backend**: Streamlit (Python) — single-file app in `dashboard.py`
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL via REST API) — stores enriched profiles, NOT screening results
- **AI Screening**: OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` (default), `gpt-4o`, or Claude Haiku (`anthropic`)
- **Profile Data**: Crustdata API (enrichment), PhantomBuster (scraping)
- **Email Lookup**: SalesQL API
- **Config**: Google Sheets (company lists, universities, blacklists) + local CSV filters

## Architecture Decisions

### Screening is ALWAYS fresh per JD
- Screening results are NOT stored in Supabase — each JD gets a fresh evaluation
- Profile enrichment data (raw Crustdata JSON) IS stored in Supabase
- Session-level results are kept in `st.session_state['screening_results']`

### Experience & durations are pre-computed in Python
- Total career experience is calculated in `dashboard.py` (search for `calculate_total_experience` or the experience limit check block)
- `compute_role_durations()` calculates per-role months from all `past_employers` + `current_employers` in raw Crustdata JSON
- Durations formatted as `Xy Ym` (e.g., `4y 2m`) or just `Xm` if under a year (e.g., `7m`)
- Company-level stability summary groups roles by company (handles promotions), flags short stints (<12mo)
- `STABILITY VERDICT` is a hard cap: FAIL (3+ short stints → max score 4, current <6mo → max score 5) or PASS
- `trim_raw_profile()` strips logos/IDs/long descriptions from raw JSON (54-64% token reduction)
- Military service (IDF) is detected and excluded from "reject >X years" checks
- A `EXPERIENCE LIMIT CHECK` verdict is pre-computed and injected into the prompt
- The AI should NEVER recalculate durations or experience — it must use the pre-computed values

### Israeli military service handling
- Israeli military is mandatory (age 18-21) and excluded from experience limits
- Military keywords: idf, mamram, unit 8200, talpiot, israeli air force, c4i, etc.
- Two metrics: TOTAL CAREER SPAN (with military) and INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE (without military)
- The AI uses INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE for "reject >X years" rules

### Error handling & resilience
- Custom exception hierarchy in `error_handling.py` (see section below)
- Retry with exponential backoff via `retry_with_backoff()` decorator
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascade failures to external services
- Token bucket rate limiting in `api_helpers.py` protects API quotas
- Input validation in `security.py` for LinkedIn URLs, text inputs, API keys

## Critical Functions in dashboard.py

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `screen_profile()` | Screens a single profile against JD via OpenAI/Claude |
| `screen_profiles_batch()` | Parallel screening with ThreadPoolExecutor |
| `compute_role_durations()` | Pre-calculates per-role durations (Xy Ym) + stability verdict from raw JSON |
| `trim_raw_profile()` | Strips logos/IDs/long descriptions from raw JSON (54-64% token savings) |
| `build_raw_data_index()` | Indexes raw data by LinkedIn URL for fast lookup |
| `fetch_raw_data_for_batch()` | Loads raw data from DB for a batch (memory efficient) |
| `enrich_batch()` | Batch enrich profiles via Crustdata API |
| `apply_pre_filters()` | Apply pre-filtering rules before screening |
| `normalize_phantombuster_columns()` | Normalize PhantomBuster CSV columns |
| `launch_phantombuster_agent()` | Launch a PhantomBuster scraping agent |

## Error Handling & Resilience Patterns

### Exception hierarchy (`error_handling.py`)
```
ApplicationError (base)
├── ExternalServiceError  — API errors (service name, status code, response body)
│   └── RateLimitError    — Rate limit errors (includes retry_after)
├── ValidationError       — Input validation errors
├── DatabaseError         — Database operation errors
└── CircuitBreakerError   — Circuit breaker is open (service temporarily unavailable)
```

### Retry decorator
Use `retry_with_backoff()` from `error_handling.py` for API calls that may fail transiently. It supports configurable max retries, base delay, and exception filtering.

### Circuit breaker
`get_service_circuit()` returns a circuit breaker per external service. After a threshold of failures, the circuit opens and fast-fails requests for a cooldown period, preventing cascade failures.

### Rate limiting
`api_helpers.py` provides a `RateLimiter` class (token bucket algorithm) and `rate_limited()` decorator. Use `get_rate_limiter()` to get a limiter for a specific provider.

### Input validation
`security.py` provides validation functions: `validate_linkedin_url()`, `validate_google_sheets_url()`, `validate_text_input()`, `validate_api_key_format()`, `validate_job_description()`. Use these at system boundaries (user input, external data).

## Screening Prompt Architecture

The screening prompt sent to OpenAI has these sections (in order):
1. **Role-specific rubric** from `prompts.py` (e.g., FULLSTACK_ISRAEL)
2. **Company description analysis** instructions
3. **Anti-hallucination rules**
4. **Assessment rules** (signal check, tiered scoring)
5. **User prompt** with JD + pre-calculated experience + raw JSON

### Pre-calculated sections injected into user prompt:
- **Role durations** from `compute_role_durations()` — every role with `Xy Ym` duration + stability verdict
- **Trimmed profile** from `trim_raw_profile()` — raw JSON with noise removed
- Current employer (title, company, start date, duration)
- Lead/management experience (months calculated, consulting excluded)
- Fullstack experience (title + skills analysis)
- DevOps experience (title + skills analysis)
- Total career experience with EXPERIENCE LIMIT CHECK verdict

## Common Pitfalls

### AI hallucinating experience/duration numbers
The AI (especially gpt-4o-mini) may try to recalculate experience or role durations from raw JSON and get it wrong. The fix: `compute_role_durations()` pre-calculates all durations in Python (formatted as `Xy Ym`), and a `STABILITY VERDICT` + `EXPERIENCE LIMIT CHECK` are injected as hard-cap verdicts the AI must follow. Additionally, `trim_raw_profile()` reduces token usage by 54-64%.

### "Already screened" profiles
Screening is always fresh per JD. Never skip profiles based on previous scores. Different JDs = different scores.

### Memory management
- Raw Crustdata JSON is 20-50KB per profile
- Batch processing loads raw data per-batch, not all at once
- Session state is cleaned after screening completes
- Max ~2-3 concurrent Streamlit users on free tier

### Overqualification rules
Only reject titles the JD EXPLICITLY lists. "Team Lead" is NOT overqualified unless the JD says so. Read the JD's reject list literally.

### Duplicate functions
`normalize_crustdata_profile()` exists in both `normalizers.py` (canonical) and `dashboard.py` (inline copy). The canonical version in `normalizers.py` is the source of truth.

### URL matching & "already enriched" counts
**READ `.claude/skills/url-flow/SKILL.md` FIRST** when debugging URL issues.

- **Crustdata echoes input**: `query_linkedin_profile_urn_or_slug` field returns our exact input URL — this is the PRIMARY matching method (Tier 1)
- **Problem**: Crustdata's `linkedin_flagship_url` is often different from input (e.g., `yderman` for `yoav-derman-365736152`)
- **Dual storage**: DB stores both `linkedin_url` (Crustdata canonical) and `original_url` (input URL)
- **Matching cascade**: 5-tier matching in `enrich_batch()` — query echo → username → base → reversed → hyphen-free → name-based
- **Multi-source limitation**: `original_url` is single TEXT field — if same profile uploaded from PhantomBuster AND Jam CSV with different URLs, only the latest is stored
- **Debug**: Check debug expander in Enrich tab, search DB by name, verify `original_url` is set
- **Fix pattern**: Update `original_url` in DB if profile was saved without it

## Skills (Claude Code)

| Skill | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/screen` | `.claude/skills/screen/SKILL.md` | Team leader: coordinates parallel screening agents |
| `/email-opener` | `.claude/skills/email-opener/SKILL.md` | Generate personalized outreach emails |
| `/pre-filter-candidates` | `.claude/skills/pre-filter-candidates/SKILL.md` | Pre-filter profiles before screening |
| `/filter-csv-columns` | `.claude/skills/filter-csv-columns/SKILL.md` | CSV column filtering for recruiter review |
| `/phantom-pre-filter` | `.claude/skills/phantom-pre-filter/SKILL.md` | Pre-filter raw PhantomBuster CSV before enrichment |
| (email-personal-note) | `skills/email-personal-note/SKILL.md` | Generate personal notes for follow-up emails |
| (email-subject-line) | `skills/email-subject-line/SKILL.md` | Generate email subject lines with angle variation |

### Reference Skills (Auto-Consult)

These skills are NOT user-invocable. Claude should automatically read them when working on related issues:

| Skill | Path | When to Consult |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| url-flow | `.claude/skills/url-flow/SKILL.md` | **URL matching bugs**, "already enriched" count wrong, profiles not deduping, enrichment URL mismatches, `original_url` issues |

## Prompt Templates (prompts.py)

### Israel Engineering
`BACKEND_ISRAEL`, `FRONTEND_ISRAEL`, `FULLSTACK_ISRAEL`, `DEVOPS_ISRAEL`, `TEAMLEAD_ISRAEL`, `PRODUCT_ISRAEL`, `MOBILE_ISRAEL`

### Global GTM
`SALES_GLOBAL`, `SDR_GLOBAL`, `MARKETING_GLOBAL`, `CUSTOMER_SUCCESS_GLOBAL`, `SOLUTIONS_ENGINEER_GLOBAL`

### Other
`ENGINEERING_GLOBAL`, `MANAGER`, `VP`, `DATASCIENCE`, `AUTOMATION`, `AI_ENGINEER`, `GENERAL`

### Prompt selection
- `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` dict maps role keys to prompt templates
- `DEFAULT_SCREENING_PROMPT` uses `GENERAL` as fallback
- `db.py:match_prompt_by_keywords()` finds the best prompt for a JD based on keyword matching
- Prompts can also be stored/customized in Supabase via `screening_prompts` table

## Database Schema (Supabase)

### `profiles` table (enrichment data only)
- `linkedin_url` (UNIQUE), `raw_data` (JSONB), `name`, `current_title`, `current_company`
- `all_employers[]`, `all_titles[]`, `all_schools[]`, `skills[]` (GIN-indexed arrays)
- `email`, `email_source`, `status` (enriched/screened/contacted/archived)
- `enriched_at`, `screened_at`, `contacted_at` (timestamps)
- Screening fields: `screening_score`, `screening_fit_level`, `screening_summary`, `screening_reasoning`

### `api_usage_logs` table
- Provider, operation, credits, tokens, cost tracking
- Indexed on provider and created_at

### `screening_prompts` table
- `role_type`, `name`, `prompt_text`, `keywords[]`, `is_default`
- Managed via `sql/screening_prompts.sql`

### Views
- `profiles_needing_screening` — enriched profiles awaiting screening
- `pipeline_stats` — funnel metrics (pending, screened, contacted, fit levels)

### Migrations
11 migration files in `migrations/` (002-010 + create_api_usage_logs). Managed by `db_migrations.py` with checksum verification. Initial schema in `supabase_setup.sql`.

## Testing

Run tests with: `pytest`

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `conftest.py` | Pytest fixtures: MockOpenAIResponse, MockOpenAIClient, shared profile/JD fixtures |
| `test_screening.py` | AI screening logic tests with sample JDs and profiles |
| `test_mocking_services.py` | External service mocking patterns, error handling, concurrency |
| `test_screening_fixes.py` | Regression tests for `format_past_positions()` and `format_education()` |
| `test_screening_parameterized.py` | Parameterized tests with `pytest.mark.parametrize` |

## Development Setup

1. **DevContainer** (recommended): Python 3.11, auto-forwards port 8501
2. **Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (streamlit, pandas, requests, openai, anthropic, gspread, google-auth, streamlit-authenticator, bcrypt, plotly)
3. **Config**: Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in API keys (Crustdata, OpenAI, PhantomBuster, Google credentials)
4. **Run**: `streamlit run dashboard.py`
5. **Filter data**: CSV files in `filters/` (blacklist.csv, not_relevant_companies.csv, target_companies.csv, universities.csv)

## Conventions

- Screening happens through OpenAI API or Claude Haiku (anthropic) for the dashboard
- Claude Code skills (`/screen`, `/email-opener`) use Claude for agent-based workflows
- Config lives in `config.json` — never commit API keys
- CSV exports use UTF-8-BOM for Excel compatibility
- LinkedIn URLs are normalized before storage (`normalize_linkedin_url()` in `normalizers.py`)
- Security validation should use `security.py` functions for user input at system boundaries
- API calls to external services should use `api_helpers.py` wrappers for rate limiting
- Filter CSVs live in `filters/` directory
- Streamlit theme: dark mode with purple primary (`#615fff`)

## Scheduled Jobs / DB Refresh

### What runs daily

`.github/workflows/db-refresh.yml` runs at **03:00 UTC every day** (and can be triggered manually with `gh workflow run db-refresh.yml`). It re-enriches stale, sparse profiles via `scripts/reenrich_sparse_profiles.py` so the dashboard always reads up-to-date current-employer data.

### Guardrails

1. **Daily cap:** the workflow passes `--limit 250` to the refresh script. At Crustdata's 3-credits-per-profile rate that's ~750 credits/day. To change, edit `DAILY_LIMIT` and `PROJECTED_DAILY_SPEND` in the workflow's `env:` block.
2. **Monthly cap:** the workflow runs `scripts/check_monthly_credit_budget.py` first. That script reads `api_usage_logs` from Supabase, sums `credits_used` for `provider='crustdata'` since the first instant of the current calendar month (UTC), and refuses to proceed if `mtd_spend + projected_spend > MONTHLY_CAP`. Today `MONTHLY_CAP=22000`. The preflight exits **75 (`EX_TEMPFAIL`)** to signal "skip this run, don't fail the workflow"; the workflow catches that and exits cleanly.

The monthly cap is a **shared budget** — it counts every Crustdata credit, not only auto-refresh credits. That's intentional: if humans burn the budget on manual searches, the auto-refresh yields rather than racing. See the docstring in `scripts/check_monthly_credit_budget.py` for the full rationale.

### One-time setup

1. **Create the tracking issue (once):**
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "DB refresh log" \
     --body "Daily auto-refresh runs append a comment here." \
     --label "automation"
   ```
   Note the issue number it prints.
2. **Set the repo variable so the workflow knows where to comment:**
   ```bash
   gh variable set DB_REFRESH_ISSUE_NUMBER --body "<issue-number>"
   ```
3. **Add four GitHub Actions secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - `CRUSTDATA_API_KEY` — Crustdata API token.
   - `SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL.
   - `SUPABASE_KEY` — Supabase service-role key (needs read on `api_usage_logs` and read/write on `profiles`).
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` — needed only because some transitive imports may touch it; can be a placeholder until you decide otherwise.

The workflow's `permissions:` block grants `issues: write` only — the narrow escape hatch to the repo's default `contents: read` posture. It does this so the daily summary can be posted to the tracking issue. No other write scopes are granted.

### Adjusting caps

All knobs live in `.github/workflows/db-refresh.yml`'s `env:` block:
- `DAILY_LIMIT` and `PROJECTED_DAILY_SPEND` — keep these in sync (3 credits per profile).
- `MONTHLY_CAP` — the hard ceiling the preflight enforces.
- `MAX_AGE_DAYS`, `MIN_CURRENT_EMPLOYERS`, `BATCH_SIZE` — staleness filter and Crustdata batch size, forwarded to the refresh script.

### Triggering manually

```bash
gh workflow run db-refresh.yml
```
Watch the tracking issue for the new comment, or open the run in the Actions tab for full logs.
