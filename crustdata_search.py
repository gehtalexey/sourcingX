Crustdata People Search Database API Client

This module provides functions to search Crustdata's 100M+ professional database.
Used by the Search tab in dashboard.py to find candidates before enrichment.

API Endpoint: POST https://api.crustdata.com/person/search (v2025-11-01,
search_people_db_v2). The legacy /screener/persondb/search client
(search_people_db) was removed 2026-09-24; Crustdata stops serving every
/screener/* endpoint on 2026-09-30.

Usage:
    from crustdata_search import search_people_db_v2, build_filters, normalize_search_results_to_df

    # Build filters from UI inputs
    filters = build_filters(
        title="Backend Engineer",
        company="Google",
        location="Israel",
        experience_min=3,
        experience_max=10
    )

    # Search
    results = search_people_db_v2(filters, limit=100)

    # Convert to DataFrame for pipeline
    df = normalize_search_results_to_df(results['profiles'])

    not a count of good matches.

            developer-tools startups in Israel".
        limit: Results to return (1-100, default 20).
        cursor: Pagination cursor from a previous response.

            terms only), or "semantic" (vector/meaning only).

    endpoint — the replacement for the legacy /screener/persondb/search
    client (search_people_db, removed 2026-09-24). Takes the legacy filters
    dict shape (build_filters() output);
    remaps the legacy column/AND-OR grammar to the new field-based grammar
    internally via _remap_filters(), so callers don't change.

    IMPORTANT: unlike the legacy endpoint (compact=false), /person/search
    does NOT return `skills` or `summary` in results — they're filterable
    but stripped from the response (verified live 2026-07-20). Every
    returned profile is passed through semantic_profile_to_legacy_shape()

    shape), which marks each result `_semantic_incomplete: True` so

    thin profiles for the existing "1. Load" tab enrichment queue; SourcingX
    also auto-fills them right before AI Screen regardless (see

# Fills in skills/summary/employment history for profiles the new search
# endpoints can't return them for. Async job: submit up to 10,000 LinkedIn
# URLs, poll for completion, download one JSON record per profile. Base
# profile = 1 credit (additive pricing, same as sync /person/enrich).
# Distinct from the legacy enrich_batch() in dashboard.py (25 URLs/call,
# 3 credits/profile, no rate limiter/retry) — do not confuse the two.

# Retry allowlist deliberately narrow: RateLimitError (429) only. This
# is a POST to Crustdata's PAID /batch/person/enrich — once the request
# leaves this process, we can no longer tell "rejected" apart from
# "accepted and started" for anything except a gateway-level 429. A
# connection loss, a client-side timeout, a genuine 5xx, or an
# unparseable 2xx body can all happen AFTER Crustdata already accepted
# and started the job; auto-retrying any of those resubmits the SAME
# URLs as a SECOND paid batch job (double-charge fix, 2026-08-04). This
# list is intentionally kept in lockstep with the allowlist in
# _submit_definitely_never_started() below — anything ambiguous is
# treated as possibly-paid and left for the caller/human to reconcile,
# not silently retried.

    VERIFIED LIVE 2026-08-04 (two real 1-credit calls against

    tolerated here even though it hasn't been observed live, since other
    v2025-11-01 endpoints in this file use that shape and Crustdata's API
    isn't perfectly consistent call to call — worst case a wrong guess here

    trailing slash and nothing else. Returns None for anything else,
    including lookalike hosts and non-profile paths, so callers can't
    accidentally trust a non-LinkedIn domain or a non-person URL.

    The path check is intentionally strict — require the path to BEGIN
    with `/in/` and contain exactly one further non-empty segment — not
    merely "contains /in/ somewhere" (Codex review, PR #127, round 4,

    with slug "target" and identity-match a genuine `/in/target` URL,

    payload clear this gate even though it isn't a real person-profile
    URL at all. That would defeat the wrong-person protection this gate
    exists for — this repo's last line of defense against writing one
    person's data onto another person's row in the shared profiles
    table. Fail closed: any path shape other than exactly one slug
    segment returns None, never a guess.

      HIGH): requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError — raised by
      response.json() on a malformed/truncated 2xx body, i.e. AFTER
      Crustdata returned a success status and may already be running the
      job — is itself a ValueError subclass. A bare `isinstance(exc,
      ValueError)` check would misclassify that as "definitely never
      started" and hide real spend, exactly the failure mode this
      function exists to prevent. ValidationError has no relationship to
      ValueError, so this allowlist entry can only ever match
      submit_batch_enrich()'s own pre-request checks.
    - AuthenticationError (401) / RateLimitError (429): the request was
      rejected by Crustdata's gateway before any job processing could
      begin.
    - A generic 4xx (ExternalServiceError with a real 400-499
      status_code straight off an HTTP response, excluding the 5xx-only
      ServiceUnavailableError subclass): the same kind of explicit
      rejection Codex's own examples named ("DNS failure, 4xx rejection,
      auth error").

    Nothing else qualifies — in particular NOT a bare requests.Timeout/
    ConnectionError (translated by submit_batch_enrich() into
    ExternalServiceError(status_code=504) / ServiceUnavailableError
    respectively), NOT a genuine 5xx response, NOT malformed/unparseable
    JSON on a 2xx response, and NOT the "200 but no batch_id in the
    response body" case — all of those mean we simply don't know whether
    Crustdata received and started processing the request. Any exception
    type not explicitly recognized above also falls through to "False"
    (ambiguous) — fail closed: when we can't prove we didn't pay, assume
    we might have.

    No client-side idempotency/request key is used here because
    Crustdata's v2025-11-01 batch-enrich API doesn't document support
    for one (checked docs.crustdata.com and this repo's Crustdata API
    reference skill, 2026-08-04) — a retried submit after an ambiguous
    failure can't be deduplicated server-side, so the caller is left
    with the `unknown` bucket's diagnostics for manual reconciliation
    rather than an automatic dedupe.

    This is the function screening calls (via dashboard.py's

    anyway rather than block a whole batch over a few unmatched people.

            "batch_ids": [...],
        }

    Unknown billing (Codex review, PR #127, round 2, 2026-08-04): a job
    that was successfully SUBMITTED and ACCEPTED by Crustdata may already
    be running (and billing) even if we then lose the ability to read its
    outcome — a transient error while polling status, a poll timeout with
    no terminal status ever observed, or a download/parse failure AFTER
    Crustdata reported the job complete. The previous version collapsed
    all three into `records = []`, which flows into `unmatched` —
    indistinguishable from Crustdata genuinely finding nothing, and
    reported to usage logging as a clean, free, zero-credit run. That is
    backwards for a cost-control PR: it hides spend in exactly the
    direction that flatters us. These three cases now land in `unknown`
    instead, are never silently treated as free, and dashboard.py logs
    them as an error/unknown-spend event carrying the batch_id(s) so the
    account balance can be reconciled manually. When Crustdata's own
    status payload happens to report a fulfilled count for a job we
    otherwise couldn't fully read (see `_status_fulfilled_hint()`), it's
    surfaced via
    `unknown_diagnostics[i]["fulfilled_hint"]` rather than discarded —
    but it is NOT folded into `credits_used`, which stays a conservative,
    only-what-we-actually-validated number.

    Deduplicates by normalized URL BEFORE submitting (Codex review, PR
    #127, 2026-08-04): a caller-supplied list containing the same URL
    twice (verbatim, or as two strings that normalize to the same profile)
    previously got submitted to Crustdata unchanged — paying for and
    fetching the same profile twice — while `requested`/`fulfilled`/
    `credits_used` were derived from a de-duplicated set, silently
    UNDER-counting the true spend. Only one representative raw string per
    normalized identity is ever sent to Crustdata; `by_url` is still
    populated under every one of the caller's original duplicate strings
    (not just the representative), so callers indexing results against
    their own input list — including the duplicate — still get a hit at
    every position.

    Every downloaded record is run through the SAME identity+content gate
    as the sync path, _is_valid_person_data() (Codex review, PR #127,
    round 2, 2026-08-04): round 1 hardened only sync_enrich_profile()'s
    match selection; this endpoint's records were still trusted on the
    strength of `original_identifier` alone, with no check that the
    payload's OWN claimed LinkedIn URL actually matched what was
    submitted for it. A record that echoes the right identifier but
    carries a wrong person (or an empty shell) is now counted in
    `rejected`, NOT mapped into `by_url`, and NOT counted fulfilled —
    same standard, same reasoning: a missed enrichment costs nothing, a
    wrongly-trusted one corrupts a row four other projects read.

    Adapt one nested v2025-11-01 person-search profile (as returned by

    Use OpenAI gpt-4o-mini to expand a term into common variations.

    Args:
        term: The user's input (e.g., "team leader", "SaaS startups in Tel Aviv")
        field_type: 'title', 'skill', 'company', 'location', 'school', or 'keywords'
        openai_api_key: OpenAI API key
        exclude: List of already-suggested values to exclude from results
        geo_context: Optional geographic scope (e.g. "Israel", "Tel Aviv") read
            from the user's Location filter. Only injected into prompts for
            field types where region matters in practice — currently 'company'
            and 'school'. Has no effect for 'location' (would be circular) or
            for skill/keyword expansions (region-neutral).

    Returns:
        List of 5-10 variations (always includes the original term for title/skill types).
        On failure, returns [term] (graceful fallback).
